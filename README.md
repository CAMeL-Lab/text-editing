# Enhancing Text Editing for Grammatical Error Correction

This repo contains code and pretrained models to reproduce the results in our paper [Enhancing Text Editing for Grammatical Error Correction: Arabic as a Case Study]().

## Requirements:

The code was written for python>=3.10, pytorch 1.12.1, and transformers 4.30.0. You will need a few additional packages. Here's how you can set up the environment using conda (assuming you have conda and cuda installed):

```bash

git clone https://github.com/CAMeL-Lab/text-editing.git
cd text-editing

conda create -n text-editing python=3.10
conda activate text-editing

pip install -e .
```
